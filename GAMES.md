## The Vibe

The general vibe we are going for with our data is games that feel like they have their own unique *world*. The best games are immersive first person experiences that put you in a world and allow you to explore it, discovering and interacting with your environment, characters, and enemies as you go. The most exemplary games for this would be Cyberpunk 2077, Skyrim, Fallout, Outer Wilds, No Mans Sky, Myst. We intend for these games to teach our models to create large and interesting worlds. Secondly, we are also interested in games that display unique movement and environments that may be more linear or closed form or multiplayer (think games like Battlefield, Call of Duty, Ghostrunner, or Talos Principle 1). These games can teach our models how one might move around and look around in closed spaces, while being easier to learn than larger complex games. First person puzzle or adventure games are also permissible. In order to end up with a realistic model, we are generally not permitting games that came out before 2010, though there is some wiggle room for graphically advanced games.
