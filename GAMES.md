# Preferred Games

You may have heard that we are offering to buy games for people so long as they commit to getting us a significant amount of data from that game.

The caveat with this is that we are choosing which games to buy to control the data mixture. We will only buy _preferred games_. While you can use the list below as reference, this refers to games that are:

- First-person
- High-quality/detailed (Need not be AAA/new, i.e. Crysis 3)
- Action-packed (doesn't need to be fighting, just lots of events happening beyond moving/looking around)

If you would like a game that fits these criteria and are willing to collect data for it, let us know and we can get you a key!

Note that not all games in the below list necessarily meet the above criteria, and that failing to meet this criteria does not make a game "bad data".

Some games support both first- and third-person mode; where possible, please play games in first-person mode.

Games marked as `(admin)` have been reported to require running OWL Control in administrator mode to record correctly. Please verify your recordings are not all-black when recording these games.

# Usage Guidelines

**Be careful with voice chat!** While OWL Control does not capture microphone input, it will capture other people's voice chat in games. Here's what to watch out for:

- **Your own voice (✅):** Never recorded (microphone is not captured).
- **NPC voices (✅):** Fine to record - we want to hear what they're saying.
- **Other players in voice chat (❌):** Please avoid recording this. The model might learn their voices and it's a privacy risk. Instead, use Discord or another external voice chat solution so their conversations won't be recorded.

**Replaying games is OK!** It's perfectly fine to replay games you've already played, but try to play a bit differently between playthroughs. This could mean different approaches, strategies, or playstyles. It's okay if you can't play _that_ differently - we're looking to cover as many of the ways you can play games as possible.

**Mods are OK!** Feel free to use game modifications (mods) while recording. We're happy to collect data from modded playthroughs as well - it represents valid gameplay scenarios.
